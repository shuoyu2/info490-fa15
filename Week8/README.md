## Time Series Data ##

In this week, you will learn about time series data, how to work with them in Pandas and how to visualize them by using Seaborn. Time Series data are everywhere, and while often simple in content (e.g., a one dimensional array indexed by time) they often support rich data mining opportunities. As an example, the last lesson in this week focuses on mining twitter streams, which can be viewed as a time series.

### Objectives ###

#####By the end of this lesson, you should accomplish the following learning objectives:######

- Understand the basic components of a time series.
- Understand how to use the Pandas Series data structure to manage time series data.
- Understand how to use Searbon to visualize and analyze time series data.
- Understand how to authenticate with Twitter.
- Understand how to find and extract tweets  from Twitter.
